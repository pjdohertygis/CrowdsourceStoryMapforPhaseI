# CrowdsourceStoryMapforPhaseI
This is a repository - but I am not a developer so would like to document what we have done and allow others to contribute ideas or even code. 


# Audience
Developers - https://github.com/Esri/storymap-crowdsource
This is a great app but there are some areas where it can be improved. It is meant for telling stories, but not ideal for categorization of data. It is possible through development, but not out of the box. 

Configurers - https://storymaps.arcgis.com/en/app-list/crowdsource/
This is a very easy to delpoy application and I'd like to share my standard operating procedure below (not very detailed, made during the heat of battle). 

# Examples

# Challenge

1) I don't know how to use GitHub
2) App does not provide configuration for adding focused questions "What is the photo?" 
*This is something that is very possible through ArcGIS Online (see Survey123) but the app itself does not come with it.*
3) Keeping the development of code close enough to the original so it still is easy to use. 
4) Finding the data on social media is exhaustive and none (<5%) of it is geotagged, how can we enable those with geospatial skills to more easily harvest the photos. This can be using newly developed tools or just better workflow.

# SOP for Social Media

This is very rough, drafted up during the heat of battle in Harvey.
